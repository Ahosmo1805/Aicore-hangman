# Aicore-hangman

This Python-based Hangman game allows users to guess letters in an attempt to reveal a hidden word. The game checks each guessed letter, updates the word accordingly, and tracks the remaining lives. 

## How It Works:
- The user inputs a letter, and the game checks if it is part of the word.
- The number of lives and the remaining letters are updated after each guess.
- The game follows a logical flow using a `Hangman` class, with several methods to manage the gameplay.
